# CRP – C-reactive protein
CRP stands for C-reactive protein. The liver produces this protein in response to bodily inflammation. A common indicator of infection and inflammation is CRP.

Your body uses inflammation as a defense mechanism and as a healing agent for tissues after an injury, illness, or other disease. Acute (sudden) inflammation might be transient. Inflammation of this kind is typically advantageous. A cut on your skin, for instance, can expand, get red, and ache for a few days. They represent inflammation. Your body might experience internal inflammation as well.

Inflammation can harm healthy tissues if it persists for too long. Chronic inflammation is the term used to describe this. Persistent inflammation can be dangerous and can be brought on by autoimmune conditions, infections, and other illnesses. Moreover, recurring irritation or injury to your tissues, such as from smoking or environmental toxins, can result in chronic inflammation.

CRP levels in the blood are measured through blood tests known as CRP testing. The test is routinely prescribed by doctors to aid in the detection and management of inflammatory diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis. It can also be used to keep track of illnesses like sepsis and pneumonia.

The CRP test is a simple blood test that is frequently performed in a lab. The most common reason for doctors to request CRP tests is to look for inflammation or infection in the body.

The test can aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of a wide range of medical disorders, including:

Autoimmune diseases: CRP tests can help with the diagnosis and follow-up of inflammatory bowel disease, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.

Heart illnesses: Elevated CRP levels may be a sign of increased risk for heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases.

Infections: CRP levels may rise in the presence of contaminations, and monitoring CRP levels can help medical professionals determine the efficacy of a given course of action.

Control following surgery: CRP levels can be used to track a patient’s post-operative healing and any indications of infection or inflammation.

Autoimmune diseases: Autoimmune diseases including vasculitis and polymyalgia rheumatica can increase CRP levels.

The progression of COVID-19 can occasionally be predicted with a CRP test. Higher CRP levels have been linked to a higher risk of severe disease development in COVID-19 patients, according to studies. 2

The chance of a person having a heart attack or stroke can also be predicted using the high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) test, which analyses extremely low levels of CRP. The hs-CRP, along with a cholesterol test, can assist in determining whether or not statin medications or other preventive measures are required.

Although “normal” CRP values differ from lab to lab and can range from 0.8 to 1.0 mg/dL (or 8 to 10 mg/L), it is widely agreed that a reading of less than this is normal. CRP levels are typically less than 0.3 mg/dL in healthy persons.

A slight increase in CRP levels—typically between 0.3 and 1.0 mg/dL—does not always indicate the presence of a disease that necessitates medical attention. Females, people using hormone replacement treatment, and people with high body mass indices might have higher CRP levels. Insomnia and depression have been correlated with mildly increased CRP. These elements will be taken into account by your doctor when interpreting the CRP test results.

The presence of inflammation in your body is often indicated by a CRP level greater than 1.0 mg/dL, although it does not specify its source or location. Several different types of infections, autoimmune disorders, certain malignancies, and illnesses involving the lungs or pancreas have been linked to extremely high levels of CRP. Your doctor might request additional testing if your CRP level is in this range before reaching a diagnosis.

For further information about your results, it is important to speak with your doctor due to differences in laboratory procedures and reference ranges.

In conclusion, by identifying and tracking internal inflammation and infection, CRP tests can help with the diagnosis and treatment of a number of medical disorders. High CRP levels in the blood can signify infection or inflammation, while low CRP levels are normal and may indicate that there is no inflammation in the body.
